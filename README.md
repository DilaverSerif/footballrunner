# footballrunner Basic HyperCasual Game

Explanation
You control a character that aims to do a touchdown.
By default, the player character moves in the right lane. While
holding the input(mouse/touch) character switches to the left lane and starts to move faster. It should be noted that movement can be interrupted when the player releases input earlier(see the video).
Player wins the game when their character scores a touchdown.
Player loses the game when their character collides with an enemy character.
